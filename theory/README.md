# Theoretical playground

The Mathematica notebooks in this directory are my personal playground. They are here mainly for backup reasons and provided to you on an AS-IS basis, without any warranty, support, etc.

**Anything you do with them happens at your own risk.**

## Recreation of the standard modules

You can try to recreate the `cpp` files in the `offt\src\backend\standard_modules` directory by performing the following steps, in that order, with a recent version of Mathematica (I am using 13.0)
1. Open `VariableAllocation2.nb` and change `$ModulesTargetPath` to the appropriate target folder on your system.
2. Open `Bilinear4.nb` and select Evaluation --> Evaluate Notebook from the menu
3. Go to `VariableAllocation2.nb` and select Evaluation --> Evaluate Notebook from the menu

All of this takes several minutes to complete on my 10 year old laptop computer.

**Again, if you do this, you will be doing so at your own risk.**
